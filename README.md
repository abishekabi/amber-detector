Our project ‘Amber Detection’ was developed so that it can help identify any car driving by with the details that are sent by Amber Alert. So our model will identify the make , model and color of the car for an identification to be made. This model would be ideally using the images from the dash camera of the car. This technology would help in so many areas but most importantly in the safety of the children 

Our Project has three modules -

1. Car License Plate Detector and Reader
2. Car Model Classifier
3. Car Colour Classifier
